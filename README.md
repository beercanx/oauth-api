# A Ktor bare-bones OAuth API

An attempt to create an OAuth 2 service as close and on spec as possible, it attempts to provide: 
* the ability to scale components without running everything everywhere.
* contain various types of automation test packs, from api, to browser, to load testing.
* provide test consumers that will demonstrate best practice and the various ways to integrate depending on system architecture.

## Using Gradle
```bash
# To run tests for a project, Gradle will not run tests for area's that have not had any changes.
./gradlew test

# To build an application bundle, after compiling and running test.
./gradlew build

# Remove previous build cache files, useful to force recompilation and test.
./gradlew clean

# Run the basic application
./gradlew run
```

## Building Docker
Since it's a multistage project we need to run a few commands to build and tag everything.

```bash
# Create all the all endpoints server instance
docker build --tag 'oauth-api:server-full' --target server-full .

# Create all the individual server instances [some are not yet implemented]
docker build --tag 'oauth-api:server-assets' --target server-assets .
docker build --tag 'oauth-api:server-authentication' --target server-authentication .
docker build --tag 'oauth-api:server-authorisation' --target server-authorisation .
docker build --tag 'oauth-api:server-session-info' --target server-session-info .
docker build --tag 'oauth-api:server-token' --target server-token .
docker build --tag 'oauth-api:server-token-introspection' --target server-token-introspection .
docker build --tag 'oauth-api:server-token-revocation' --target server-token-revocation .
```

## Test Consumers
There's currently one test consumer that provides Android, desktop and website support. This project is built separately
from the main application, due to it having a different set of dependency constraints that would have impacted the main 
project, see [test-consumers/compose/README.md](./test-consumers/compose/README.md) for more.
